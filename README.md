# problem-solving-and-programming
assignments and code written in C++ from my winter 2022 class

This course involves problem-solving with algorithms, and their realization as
computer programs using a structured, general purpose programming language. It
covers data types, operators, expressions, assignment, input and output, selection
and repetition control structures; modularity and procedural abstraction using
functions with parameters; structured data types, arrays, pointers and strings.
